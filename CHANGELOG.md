# Changelog

This changelog tracks changes to the playbook itself: what the standard recommends, tier
definitions, CI wiring, governance rules, and templates. It does not track any one adopting
repository's use of the standard. A repository that adopted an earlier version can read this
file to see what changed since then and decide whether to pick up the difference.

All notable changes are documented here. Entries are grouped under `### Added`, `### Changed`,
`### Fixed`, and `### Removed` as needed, following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Initial version of the standard: the four-tier system (Tier 0 through Tier 3), the README
  standard, the CI cookbook (CodeQL, Semgrep, gitleaks, Dependabot, Trivy, Codecov, SonarCloud,
  concurrency groups, SHA-pinning, dependency vulnerability auditing), the governance guide
  (CODEOWNERS, branch protection, labels and milestones), the security-docs guide (SECURITY.md
  structure, vulnerability disclosure), and starter templates.
- Docs as source of truth: a Wiki-sync pattern (`docs/wiki/` synced to the GitHub Wiki by CI,
  never edited directly there) and a PR-time "Documentation impact" declaration, checked against
  the actual diff instead of trusted on its word. Tier 2's checklist gained the PR declaration
  item; Tier 3's wiki and security-docs items reference the sync and drift-detection patterns.
- `scripts/verify-tier.mjs` and a reusable workflow (`.github/workflows/verify-tier.yml`) that
  another repository can call to check itself against this standard's mechanically-checkable
  items automatically, without copying anything. See docs/ci-cookbook.md #13.
